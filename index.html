                <h3>ABOUT THE DISEASE</h3>
                <h1>CORONAVIRUS (COVID-19)</h1>
                <p>
                    <span>COVID-19 is a new illness that can affect your lungs and airways.</span>
                    It's caused by a virus called coronavirus. It was discovered in December 2019 in Wuhan, Hubei,
                    China.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Common signs of infection include respiratory symptoms, fever, cough, shortness of breath and
                    breathing difficulties. In
                    more severe cases, infection can cause pneumonia, severe acute respiratory syndrome, kidney
                    failure and even death.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Standard recommendations to prevent infection spread include regular hand washing, covering
                    mouth and nose when coughing
                    and sneezing, thoroughly cooking meat and eggs. Avoid close contact with anyone showing symptoms
                    of respiratory illness
                    such as coughing and sneezing.
                </p>

                    fights the illness. You'll need to stay in isolation, away from other people, until you have

                                        feline coronaviruses, infect animals. Rarely, animal coronaviruses infect people
                                        and spread between people. This is
                                        suspected to be due to the virus that caused COVID-19. MERS and SARS are two
                                        examples of coronaviruses that originated

                                    <p>The virus was discovered in Wuhan in the Hubei province of China. The first
                                        infections occurred in a live animal market
                                        but later the virus spread from person to person. It is important to note that
                                        person-to-person contagion can occur on a
                                        continuum. Some viruses are highly contagious (like measles) while others are
                                        less.

                                        The virus that causes COVID-19 appears to spread easily and steadily through the
                                        community (“community spread”) in some
                                        of the affected areas . The community spread of the virus explains that people
                                        have been infected in an area, including
                                        those who are not sure how and where they contracted the virus.

                                        disease on to others. For this reason the Government recommends these patients
                                        to isolate themselves in hospital or at
                                        home (depending on how sick you are) until they become negative.

                                        Recovery time may vary and therefore the period of isolation is decided on a
                                        case by case basis based on medical
                                        consultations, infection prevention, expert checks and public health
                                        authorities. This implies that for each situation
                                        these specifics should be considered including disease severity, symptoms and
                                        laboratory test results.

                                        basis by including all of the following requirements:

                                        The patient has no fever and is not taking fever medication.
                                        The patient shows no symptoms, including cough.
                                        The patient tested negative on at least two consecutive swabs collected 24 hours
                                        apart.
                                        People who can leave isolation are not at risk of infecting others.

                                        is much to study regarding the transmissibility, severity and other
                                        characteristics associated with COVID-19.

                                        may have close contact2 with a person
                                        with symptomatic, laboratory-confirmed COVID-19 or a person under investigation.
                                        Close contacts should monitor their
                                        health; they should call their healthcare provider right away if they develop
                                        symptoms suggestive of COVID-19 (e.g.,
                                        fever, cough, shortness of breath)

                                        Close contacts should also follow these recommendations:

                                        Make sure that you understand and can help the patient follow their healthcare
                                        provider’s instructions for medication(s)
                                        and care. You should help the patient with basic needs in the home and provide
                                        support for getting groceries,
                                        prescriptions, and other personal needs.
                                        Monitor the patient’s symptoms. If the patient is getting sicker, call his or
                                        her healthcare provider and tell them that
                                        the patient has laboratory-confirmed COVID-19. This will help the healthcare
                                        provider’s office take steps to keep other
                                        people in the office or waiting room from getting infected. Ask the healthcare
                                        provider to call the local or state
                                        health department for additional guidance. If the patient has a medical
                                        emergency and you need to call 911, notify the
                                        dispatch personnel that the patient has, or is being evaluated for COVID-19.
                                        Household members should stay in another room or be separated from the patient
                                        as much as possible. Household members
                                        should use a separate bedroom and bathroom, if available.
                                        Prohibit visitors who do not have an essential need to be in the home.
                                        Household members should care for any pets in the home. Do not handle pets or
                                        other animals while sick. For more
                                        information, see COVID-19 and Animals.
                                        Make sure that shared spaces in the home have good air flow, such as by an air
                                        conditioner or an opened window, weather
                                        permitting.
                                        Perform hand hygiene frequently. Wash your hands often with soap and water for
                                        at least 20 seconds or use an
                                        alcohol-based hand sanitizer that contains 60 to 95% alcohol, covering all
                                        surfaces of your hands and rubbing them
                                        together until they feel dry. Soap and water should be used preferentially if
                                        hands are visibly dirty.
                                        Avoid touching your eyes, nose, and mouth with unwashed hands.
                                        The patient should wear a facemask when you are around other people. If the
                                        patient is not able to wear a facemask (for
                                        example, because it causes trouble breathing), you, as the caregiver, should
                                        wear a mask when you are in the same room
                                        as the patient.
                                        Wear a disposable facemask and gloves when you touch or have contact with the
                                        patient’s blood, stool, or body fluids,
                                        such as saliva, sputum, nasal mucus, vomit, urine.
                                        Throw out disposable facemasks and gloves after using them. Do not reuse.
                                        When removing personal protective equipment, first remove and dispose of gloves.
                                        Then, immediately clean your hands with
                                        soap and water or alcohol-based hand sanitizer. Next, remove and dispose of
                                        facemask, and immediately clean your hands
                                        again with soap and water or alcohol-based hand sanitizer.
                                        Avoid sharing household items with the patient. You should not share dishes,
                                        drinking glasses, cups, eating utensils,
                                        towels, bedding, or other items. After the patient uses these items, you should
                                        wash them thoroughly (see below “Wash
                                        laundry thoroughly”).
                                        Clean all “high-touch” surfaces, such as counters, tabletops, doorknobs,
                                        bathroom fixtures, toilets, phones, keyboards,
                                        tablets, and bedside tables, every day. Also, clean any surfaces that may have
                                        blood, stool, or body fluids on them.
                                        Use a household cleaning spray or wipe, according to the label instructions.
                                        Labels contain instructions for safe and
                                        effective use of the cleaning product including precautions you should take when
                                        applying the product, such as wearing
                                        gloves and making sure you have good ventilation during use of the product.
                                        Wash laundry thoroughly.
                                        Immediately remove and wash clothes or bedding that have blood, stool, or body
                                        fluids on them.
                                        Wear disposable gloves while handling soiled items and keep soiled items away
                                        from your body. Clean your hands (with
                                        soap and water or an alcohol-based hand sanitizer) immediately after removing
                                        your gloves.
                                        Read and follow directions on labels of laundry or clothing items and detergent.
                                        In general, using a normal laundry
                                        detergent according to washing machine instructions and dry thoroughly using the
                                        warmest temperatures recommended on the
                                        clothing label.
                                        Place all used disposable gloves, facemasks, and other contaminated items in a
                                        lined container before disposing of them
                                        with other household waste. Clean your hands (with soap and water or an
                                        alcohol-based hand sanitizer) immediately after
                                        handling these items. Soap and water should be used preferentially if hands are
                                        visibly dirty.
                                        Discuss any additional questions with your state or local health department or
                                        healthcare provider. Check available

                                        WHO advises rational use of medical masks to avoid unnecessary wastage of
                                        precious resources and mis-use of masks (see

                                        The most effective ways to protect yourself and others against COVID-19 are to

                                        needing special treatment. Around 1 out of every 6 people who gets COVID-19
                                        becomes seriously ill and develops
                                        difficulty breathing. Older people, and those with underlying medical problems
                                        like high blood pressure, heart problems
                                        or diabetes, are more likely to develop serious illness. People with fever,
                                        cough and difficulty breathing should seek
                                        medical attention.

                                        Protect yourself and others.

                                        Stay home if you are sick. Keep away from people who are sick. Limit close
                                        contact with others as much as possible
                                        (about 6 feet).
                                        Put your household plan into action.

                                        Stay informed about the local COVID-19 situation. Be aware of temporary school
                                        dismissals in your area, as this may
                                        affect your household’s daily routine.
                                        Continue practicing everyday preventive actions. Cover coughs and sneezes with a
                                        tissue and wash your hands often with
                                        soap and water for at least 20 seconds. If soap and water are not available, use
                                        a hand sanitizer that contains 60%
                                        alcohol. Clean frequently touched surfaces and objects daily using a regular
                                        household detergent and water.
                                        Notify your workplace as soon as possible if your regular work schedule changes.
                                        Ask to work from home or take leave if
                                        you or someone in your household gets sick with COVID-19 symptoms, or if your
                                        child’s school is dismissed temporarily.
                                        Learn how businesses and employers can plan for and respond to COVID-19.
                                        Stay in touch with others by phone or email. If you have a chronic medical
                                        condition and live alone, ask family,
                                        friends, and health care providers to check on you during an outbreak. Stay in
                                        touch with family and friends, especially
                                        those at increased risk of developing severe illness, such as older adults and
                                        people with severe chronic medical

                                        cases of COVID-19 that impact your child’s school, the school may dismiss
                                        students. Keep track of school dismissals in
                                        your community. Read or watch local media sources that report school dismissals.
                                        If schools are dismissed temporarily,
                                        use alternative childcare arrangements, if needed.

                                        If your child/children become sick with COVID-19, notify their childcare
                                        facility or school. Talk with teachers about
                                        classroom assignments and activities they can do from home to keep up with their
                                        schoolwork.

                                        Discourage children and teens from gathering in other public places while school
                                        is dismissed to help slow the spread of
